        hellooooo, my name is jaxx!  
        Im a freshman this year at PTAA.
        I have four siblings, three sisters and one brother
        ; Alyssa, Soila, Daniella and Dj. Im the
        middle kid exactly. Most of the time i am 
        playing video games or talking with friends.
        Im passionate about learning about the LGBTQIA+
        community and understanding more about it.
        Im transgender(ftm) and pansexual myself, so i
        enjoy learning about what i can do to support our
        community. I have many friends at PTAA, shoutout to
        my 6 wives.
